# Classifying Qir Quality Index In Mexico using Linear Regression

Initially , this project presents how linear regression is misfit to predict dependent variables since the data values can only achieve with some alternative regressions such as non-linear regression model.

There are 30 columns and 34207 entries but key features are carefully selected in a general way- there are 8 entries: ["PM2_5_(μg/m³)","PM10_(μg/m³)","NO2_(μg/m³)","CO_(μg/m³)","O3_(μg/m³)","temperature_2m_mean_(°C)","wind_speed_10m_(km/h)","relative_humidity_2m_(%)"] to predict target variable (AirQualityIndex)

## Task Lists

1.preprocessing
2.hanndling missing values and outliers
3.building Linear Regression
4.Evaluating Model Performance with outliers and without it
